/**
 *  Name:         Tolk_Load
 *  Description:  Initializes Tolk by loading and initializing the screen reader drivers and setting the current screen reader driver, provided at least one of the supported screen readers is active.  Also initializes COM if it has not already been initialized on the calling thread.  Calling this function more than once will only initialize COM.  You should call this function before using the functions below, though for convenience it is valid to call them at any time.  Use the return value or Tolk_IsLoaded to determine whether or not Tolk has been initialized.  This function does not return a value, as a screen reader driver failing to load is interpreted as that screen reader being unavailable.
 *  Parameters:   None.
 *  Returns:      None.

The SAPI driver will use the system default synthesizer, voice and soundcard.  This function triggers the screen reader detection process if needed.  For best performance, you can bypass the extra screen reader detection round by calling this function before calling Tolk_Load, but to support dynamic changes it can be called at any time.

Putting it last is the default and is good for using SAPI as a fallback option.  Putting it first is good for ensuring SAPI is used even when a screen reader is running, but keep in mind screen readers will still be tried if SAPI is unavailable.  This function triggers the screen reader detection process if needed.  For best performance, you can bypass the extra screen reader detection round by calling this function before calling Tolk_Load, but to support dynamic changes it can be called at any time.

Note that the drivers hard-code the common name, it is not requested from the screen reader itself.

This is the preferred function to use for sending text to a screen reader, because it uses all of the supported output methods (i.e. speech and/or braille depending on the current screen reader driver).
